			<p id="about" class="title"> About</p>
			<p class="text">Yuemeng is currently pursuing a master degree in computer science at University of Texas at Dallas, with the track of data science. Before becoming a studet of UT Dallas, he already got a degree of master scienc of public health which is focused on biostatistics in the University of Miami and a bachlor science degree of biology in Wuhan University of China. Once he did an intership at the OncoMed Pharmaceuticals during May to July of year 2015. His work of this intership was to apply R to data analysis of genechip and predict potential genes that could affect cancer development. 
			</p>
			<p class = "text">Yuemeng is going to graduate on December, 2018. Now he is seeking for intership on summer and fall on 2018. The couses that Yuemeng have mainly taken at UT Dallas are: Operating Systems, Database Design, Web Programming Languages, Big Data Analytics, Algorithm Analysis and Data Structures, Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms, Computer Architecture, Machine Learning and Statistical Method.

			<p id="project" class="title"> Project</p>
			<p class="text"> Library Engine</p>
			<ul class = "list">
				<li>Design relational schema and create a database host application that interfaces with a backend SQL database implementing a Library Management System. Users of the system are understood to be librarians.</li>
				<li>The application have the function to search books and their availability given any combination of ISBN, title, and authors, substring matching is suported.</li>
				<li>In this app, librarians could manage account of all borrowers in the library system. </li>
				<li>The application could help librarians to check out and check in books and system will calculate and pay fine of borrowers if the fail to return books on time.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p class="text">Simulation Chat Room</p>
			<ul class = "list">
				<li>Apply JAVA to simulate a char room system, though a server class, users could check other user's status like known, online, offline and send message to other users with different status. </li>
				<li>Communication between processes is fulfilled by sockects. Samaphores are ultilized to enforce mutual exclusion between critical resource.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p class="text">Experiments with a deep neural network using TensorFlow </p>
			<ul class = "list">
				<li>Using part data of mnist data set as training data, construct diffrent networks to make learning accuracy as high as possible.</li>
				<li>Gradient descent and AdamOptimizer combined with droupouts, regularization are experimented. Also convolutional layere is implemented in this project.</li>
